# clickMoneyGame.github.io

One of the first games that I created using HTML, CSS, JS and jQuery. 

The game is very simple, at the beginning you just have to pick difficulty level, which means, that the harder the level, more often taxes will reduce your cash money.

The main goal is to reach $300bln in cash by clicking golden button and by buying kiosk, shops and banks which is on the left side, and provides 10% income of the entity price every second.

Have fun!
